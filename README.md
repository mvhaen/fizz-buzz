# Agile Technical Practices Distilled: Fizz Buzz kata

The Fizz Buzz kata is a simple programming exercise that is often used to teach or practice basic programming concepts. The goal of the exercise is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but with some modifications:

- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "Fizz-Buzz" instead of the number.
  
The exercise is usually done in a group setting, with participants taking turns to write a few lines of code to implement the functionality. The goal is to practice techniques like pair programming, test-driven development, and refactoring, while also getting familiar with the syntax and structure of the programming language being used.

## Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed. See `https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started`

## Running the Program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Type `cargo run` and press Enter. This will compile the code and run the program.
3. The program will print the numbers from 1 to 100, with "Fizz", "Buzz", or "Fizz-Buzz" substituted for the appropriate multiples of 3 and 5.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Type `cargo test` and press Enter. This will compile the code and run all the tests in the project.
3. If all the tests pass, you should see a message like "test result: ok. X passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out".

That's it! Running the program and tests using `cargo` is a simple and convenient way to develop Rust applications.
